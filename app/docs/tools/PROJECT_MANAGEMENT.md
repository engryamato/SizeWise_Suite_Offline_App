# Project Management Workflows

ðŸ“¦ Phase 0.0 â€“ Project Management Setup

## Workflows

1. **Requirement Intake** â€“ Capture feature requests in the project planner with phase tags and scope summaries.
2. **Planning** â€“ Break features into isolated, testable tasks. Map dependencies using `/app/core/` modules and shared schemas.
3. **Development** â€“ Implement code in feature-specific branches with unit tests. Validate all JSON with AJV/Zod before commits.
4. **Review** â€“ Run `npm test` for â‰¥85% coverage and conduct peer review on pull requests.
5. **Release** â€“ Merge into `main` with semantic commit messages and update changelog entries.

## API Usage

The project management API exposes REST endpoints under `/services/project-api`:

- `POST /projects` â€“ create a new project. Accepts `{ name, phase, owner }` and returns `201` with project metadata.
- `GET /projects/:id` â€“ retrieve project status, including pending tasks and coverage metrics.
- `PATCH /projects/:id` â€“ update phase tags or rollback states. Returns updated record.

Clients should authenticate with JWT tokens stored by `/services/storage` and reuse shared validators from `/app/core/validators`.

## Rollback Steps

1. Tag the last known good commit: `git tag -a rollback-prep -m "pre-change snapshot"`.
2. Revert the problematic commit: `git revert <hash>`.
3. Run `npm test` to confirm stability.
4. Document the rollback in the changelog and push tags for traceability.
